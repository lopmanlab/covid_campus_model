	abstract = {Background Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology.
Methods and Findings 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible.
Conclusions To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.},

	abstract = {Background: Tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) based on reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) are being used to ?rule out? infection among high-risk persons, such as exposed inpatients and health care workers. It is critical to understand how the predictive value of the test varies with time from exposure and symptom onset to avoid being falsely reassured by negative test results. Objective: To estimate the false-negative rate by day since infection. Design: Literature review and pooled analysis. Setting: 7 previously published studies providing data on RT-PCR performance by time since symptom onset or SARS-CoV-2 exposure using samples from the upper respiratory tract (n = 1330). Patients: A mix of inpatients and outpatients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Measurements: A Bayesian hierarchical model was fitted to estimate the false-negative rate by day since exposure and symptom onset. Results: Over the 4 days of infection before the typical time of symptom onset (day 5), the probability of a false-negative result in an infected person decreases from 100\% (95\% CI, 100\% to 100\%) on day 1 to 67\% (CI, 27\% to 94\%) on day 4. On the day of symptom onset, the median false-negative rate was 38\% (CI, 18\% to 65\%). This decreased to 20\% (CI, 12\% to 30\%) on day 8 (3 days after symptom onset) then began to increase again, from 21\% (CI, 13\% to 31\%) on day 9 to 66\% (CI, 54\% to 77\%) on day 21. Limitation: Imprecise estimates due to heterogeneity in the design of studies on which results were based. Conclusion: Care must be taken in interpreting RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection?particularly early in the course of infection?when using these results as a basis for removing precautions intended to prevent onward transmission. If clinical suspicion is high, infection should not be ruled out on the basis of RT-PCR alone, and the clinical and epidemiologic situation should be carefully considered.

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of cases among children. Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms, or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from six countries. We estimate that clinical symptoms occur in 25\% (95\% CrI: 19-32\%) of infections in 10-19-year-olds, rising to 76\% (68-82\%) in over-70s, and that susceptibility to infection in under-20s is approximately half that of older adults. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children may have a relatively small impact on total cases, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. The age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility we have estimated has implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19 because of demographic differences across settings: in younger populations, the expected clinical attack rate would be lower, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will affect disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with older populations may see disproportionally more clinical cases, particularly in the later stages of the pandemic.},

	abstract = {Background 
Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been implemented to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK. Projecting the size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of different control measures has been critical to support evidence-based policymaking during the early stages of the epidemic. 

Methods We used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios, including the introduction of school closures, social distancing, shielding of elderly groups, self-isolation of symptomatic cases, and extreme "lockdown"-type restrictions. We simulated different durations of interventions and triggers for introduction, as well as combinations of interventions. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (intensive care unit, ICU) treatment, and deaths.

Findings 
We found that mitigation measures aimed at reducing transmission would likely have decreased the reproduction number, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding NHS availability. To keep ICU bed demand below capacity in the model, more extreme restrictions were necessary. In a scenario where "lockdown"-type interventions were put in place to reduce transmission, these interventions would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year in order to prevent healthcare demand exceeding availability.

Interpretation
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that extreme measures are likely required to bring the epidemic under control and to prevent very large numbers of deaths and an excess of demand on hospital beds, especially those in ICUs.},

	abstract = {Background. In late April 2009, the ﬁrst documented 2009 pandemic inﬂuenza A (pH1N1) virus infection outbreak in a university setting occurred in Delaware, with large numbers of students presenting with respiratory illness. At the time of this investigation, little was known about the severity of illness, effectiveness of the vaccine, or transmission factors of pH1N1 virus infection. We characterized illness, determined the impact of this outbreak, and examined factors associated with transmission.
Methods. Health clinic records were reviewed. An online survey was administered to all students, staff, and faculty to assess inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI), deﬁned as documented or subjective fever with cough or sore throat.
Results. From 26 April–2 May 2009, the health clinic experienced a sharp increase in visits for respiratory illness, with 1080 such visits among a total of 1430 student visits, and then a return to baseline visit levels within 2 weeks. More than 500 courses of oseltamivir were distributed, and 24 cases of inﬂuenza A (pH1N1) virus infection were conﬁrmed. Of 29,000 university students and faculty/staff, 7450 (30\%) responded to the survey. ILI was reported by 604 (10\%) of the students and 73 (5\%) of the faculty/staff. Travel to Mexico (relative risk [RR], 2.9; 95\% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.8–4.7) and participation in “Greek Week” activities (RR, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.8–2.8) were associated with ILI. Recipients of the 2008–2009 seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine had the same risk of ILI as nonrecipients (RR, 1.0). Four (3\%) of the students with ILI were hospitalized; there were no deaths.
Conclusions. pH1N1 spread rapidly through the University of Delaware community with a surge in illness over a 2-week period. Although initial cases appear to be associated with travel to Mexico, a rapid increase in cases was likely facilitated by increased student interactions during Greek Week. No protective effect from receiving seasonal inﬂuenza vaccine was identiﬁed. Although severe illness was rare, the outbreak caused a substantial burden and challenge to the university health care system. Preparedness efforts in universities and similar settings should include enhancing health care surge capacity.},

	abstract = {Background. Uncertainties regarding inﬂuenza disease impact and beneﬁts of vaccination may contribute to low vaccination rates among adults aged 50–64 years.
Methods. This prospective cohort study assessed the burden of inﬂuenza-like illness (ILI) among working adults aged 50–64 years and the effectiveness of inﬂuenza vaccination in reducing the rate of ILI and productivity losses. Employees of the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis) were invited via e-mail to participate in the study during October 2006. The study data were collected using internet-based surveys at baseline (October 2006) and during the follow-up period (from November 2006 through April 2007). Months included in the 2006–2007 inﬂuenza season were identiﬁed retrospectively from Minnesota Department of Health surveillance data. Vaccine effectiveness for reducing the rate of ILI, ILI-associated health care use, the number of days of illness, work loss, and reduced on-the-job productivity during the inﬂuenza season were assessed using multivariable regression models after controlling for important confounders.
Results. Four hundred ninety-seven persons were included in the study, 85 (17.1\%) of whom experienced an ILI. Among unvaccinated participants, ILI was responsible for 45\% of all days of illness during the inﬂuenza season, 39\% of all illness-related work days lost, and 49\% of all days with illness-related reduced on-the-job productivity. In the multivariable regression analyses, vaccination was associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in the rate of ILI (adjusted odds ratio, 0.48; 95\% conﬁdence interval, 0.27–0.86) and fewer days of illness, absenteeism, and impaired on-the-job performance.
Conclusion. ILIs were common among our study participants, accounting for a large portion of illness, work loss, and impaired work performance during the inﬂuenza season. Vaccination was associated with substantial health and productivity beneﬁts. Vaccine delivery should be improved for this high-priority group.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70\%-99\%), specificity (ie, 98\%-99.7\%), and cost (ie, \$10/test-\$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05\% and a 30\% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19–defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact.
RESULTS At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8\%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2\%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70\% sensitivity, a test with 98\% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18\%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37\%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90\%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptombased screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70\% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of \$470, \$910, or \$120, respectively, per student per semester.
