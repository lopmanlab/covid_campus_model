# COVID19 Campus Model Summary
The COVID19 Campus Model is a tool to guide mitigation strategies and resource needs for universities considering in-person instruction for Fall 2020. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) type of deterministic compartmental model that captures transmission process, allowing for estimates of direct and indirect (transmission-mediated) effects of control strategies. 

Code in this repository was used for the simulations and results presented our paper. An interactive software tool is available for additional simulations. Links below:

# Shiny web app

The application is available [online](https://epimodel.shinyapps.io/covid-university/).

## Dependencies

In order to run the app from your computer you require the following libraries:

``` R
install.packages(c(
  "shiny",
  "shinydashboard",
  "plotly",
  "EpiModel",
  "lhs",
  "tidyr",
  "purrr",
  "glue",
  "kableExtra",
  "ggplot2"
))
```

Alternatively if you use [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) to isolate your libraries and ensure reproducibility, a "renv.lock" file is present at the root of this project.

``` R
renv::restore()
```

### Run the app

To launch the app, either run from the R console:

``` R
shiny::runApp("shiny/app")
```

Or using RStudio, open either "shiny/app/ui.R" or "shiny/app/server.R" and click the "Run App" button on the top right corner of the editor.
